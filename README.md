The DC Housing Application Assistant aids DC residents and case workers apply for Section 8 housing by empowering them to automatically fill out multiple Section 8 housing applications using information collected via an online form.  Data collected once for a person can be used to populate PDF versions of housing applications.

The application relies on PDF Filler, a RESTful web-service that takes a hosted, form-fillable PDF and a form submission and returns a filled-out version of the PDF.  

PDF Filler: https://github.com/GSA-OCSIT/pdf-filler

More information coming soon.
